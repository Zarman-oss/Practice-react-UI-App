# React App Fundamentals

This repository contains a React application that serves as a beginner's guide to understanding the basic fundamentals of React. The app covers the following topics:

1. Components
2. JSX
3. Props (PropTypes, defaultProps, etc.)
4. State (Component & App Level)
5. Styling
6. Handling Events
7. Lists & Keys
8. Forms
9. Context API
10. HTTP Requests

## Getting Started

To run the application locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ Practice-react-UI-App.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd Practice-react-UI-App
```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

```
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```
npm start
```

The app should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Topics Covered

### 1. Components

React components are the building blocks of a React application. This app demonstrates the creation and usage of functional and class components.

### 2. JSX

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript, which allows you to write HTML-like code within your React components. The app showcases the usage of JSX to render UI elements.

### 3. Props

Props are used to pass data from parent components to child components. The app demonstrates the use of PropTypes to define the types of props and defaultProps to set default values.

### 4. State

State allows components to maintain and manage their own data. The app illustrates the usage of state at both component and app levels.

### 5. Styling

Styling is an essential part of any React application. This app shows different approaches to styling React components, such as using CSS classes and inline styles.

### 6. Handling Events

React components can handle various events like onClick, onChange, etc. The app covers event handling and how to respond to user interactions.

### 7. Lists & Keys

Rendering lists of data is a common task in React. The app explains how to render lists efficiently and the importance of using keys for optimization.

### 8. Forms

Forms are used to collect user input. This app demonstrates how to handle form submissions and manage form data in React.

### 9. Context API

Context API allows data to be shared across components without the need to pass props explicitly. The app showcases the usage of Context API for state management.

### 10. HTTP Requests

Performing HTTP requests is crucial for fetching data from servers. The app explains how to make HTTP requests using popular libraries like Axios or Fetch.
